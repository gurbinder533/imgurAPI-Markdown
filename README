==========================
Regarding Markdown Editor
This is a very basic client-side Markdown editor that makes use of the excellent PageDown library from StackOverflow:

http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/

The editor consists of three panes; a visual preview of the document, a textarea editor with buttons bound for common Markdown syntax, and a smaller textarea that shows the generated HTML (which is useful if you want to cut and paste).

You can find editor here:https://github.com/nefarioustim/markdown-editor/blob/master/README.md
